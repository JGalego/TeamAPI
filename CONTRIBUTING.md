# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution to TeamAPI.

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JGalego/TeamAPI.git
cd TeamAPI
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Requires Node >=22 (see `.nvmrc`) and pnpm (see `packageManager` in `package.json`).

## Everyday commands

Run from the repo root; each fans out across all packages via [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com/):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pnpm build` | Compile every package (`tsc -b`) |
| `pnpm test` | Run every package's Vitest suite |
| `pnpm lint` | ESLint over every package's `src/` |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Type-check without a full emit (`tsc -b --noEmit`) |

Try any change against the bundled sample org before opening a PR:

```bash
pnpm teamapi validate examples/acme-org
pnpm teamapi render examples/acme-org --scope topology
```

## Where things live

This is a pnpm/Turborepo monorepo:

- `packages/schema` — Zod schemas + types for the [extended Team API spec](docs/spec/teamapi-extended-v1.md).
- `packages/core` — `$ref` resolution, the org graph, cognitive-load scoring, DDD context mapping, diagram generation. The shared engine every other package builds on.
- `packages/cli` — the `teamapi` command (`validate`, `render`, `scaffold`, `generate`, `serve-api`, `serve-mcp`, `chat`).
- `packages/rest-api` — the read-only REST API (Fastify).
- `packages/mcp-server` — the MCP server exposing the org graph as tools for LLM assistants.
- `packages/chat` — the Anthropic tool-use loop backing `teamapi chat`.
- `examples/acme-org` — the sample org every README example and most tests run against. If you add a feature, prefer demonstrating it here over inventing new fixtures.
- `docs/spec/teamapi-extended-v1.md` — the human-readable spec; keep it in sync with `packages/schema/src/v1` when you change a field's shape or add a new one.

## Making a change

1. Add tests alongside the code you change (`src/__tests__/`) — every package uses Vitest.
2. If you touch `packages/schema`, check whether `docs/spec/teamapi-extended-v1.md` needs a matching update.
3. If you touch a package's public API, check whether its `README.md` still accurately describes it.
4. Run `pnpm build && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test` before opening a PR — this is exactly what CI runs.

## Releasing

This repo uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). If your change affects a published package's behavior (not just internal refactors, tests, or docs), add one:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Pick the affected package(s), a semver bump (patch/minor/major), and a one-line summary — this becomes the package's changelog entry. CI opens/updates a "Version Packages" PR from pending changesets; merging it publishes to npm.
