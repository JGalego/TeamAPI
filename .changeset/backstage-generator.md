Add a Backstage catalog generator: `teamapi generate backstage <patterns...> [--team <id>] --out <dir>` turns the resolved org graph into a Backstage `catalog-info.yaml` — a `Group` per team (with its members), a `User` per member, and, for any team with `services[]`, a `System` grouping them plus a `Component` per service, owned by that team's `Group`. Exported from `@jgalego/teamapi-core` as `buildBackstageCatalog`/`buildBackstageOrgCatalog`/`toBackstageYaml`.
