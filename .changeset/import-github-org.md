Add `teamapi import github-org <org> --out <dir>`: bootstraps `teamapi.yml` documents from an existing GitHub org instead of hand-authoring every team from scratch — one `<team-id>/teamapi.yml` per GitHub team, with members enriched from GitHub user profiles (name, email, `githubUsername`) and `services[]` inferred from the team's repos. Every generated team defaults to `type: stream-aligned` with empty `roles[]`, since GitHub teams carry neither Team Topologies typing nor a role hierarchy — both are meant to be reviewed and corrected by hand. Exported from `@jgalego/teamapi-core` as `importGithubOrg`.
