# @jgalego/teamapi-rest-api

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 5056af1: Add a live browser dashboard at `GET /dashboard`: a self-contained static page (no separate process, no build step) that fetches the same REST API it's served from — a team list with type/focus, a cognitive-load bar per team (color- and icon-coded, never color alone), free-text search, and a tabbed diagram viewer (topology / org-hierarchy / context-map) rendered client-side with Mermaid loaded from a CDN. Each section loads and fails independently, so a blocked CDN only disables the diagram tab.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- caebd20: Fixes from a full code + docs review:

  - **schema**: enforce previously-undocumented-but-unenforced rules — `roles[].id`/`members[].id`
    uniqueness, `reportsTo` must reference an existing role and can't form a cycle (including
    self-reports), `reportsTo`/`reportsToRef` are now genuinely mutually exclusive, and `x-*` vendor
    extension fields are preserved on `platform`/`reportsToRef`/`alignsWith[]` refs (previously
    silently stripped).
  - **core**: `detectConflicts` now also flags disagreeing `contextMappingPattern` declarations, not
    just disagreeing `mode`; a duplicate team id's own outbound `$ref`s are now still traversed so a
    team reachable only through the duplicate doesn't silently vanish from the graph;
    `findServiceOwner` picks a deterministic (alphabetically-first) owner when service names collide
    instead of an arbitrary graph-traversal-order one; fixed `HttpLoader.resolveUri` throwing
    "Invalid URL" when a local file references an absolute `https://` `$ref` directly; added
    `toOrgGraphDto` as the single shared serializer for "the full org graph" (now includes
    `roleEdges`, previously omitted from both REST's `/graph` and MCP's `get_org_graph`).
  - **cli**: `teamapi render`'s `--scope`/`--format` and `teamapi scaffold`'s `--type` now reject
    invalid values instead of silently falling back to a default; `--team` validation is now
    consistent across every `render` scope; `--port` is now validated as 1-65535; every command now
    warns (without failing) when the graph has unresolved references, not just `validate`;
    `teamapi chat` now caps tool-call iterations per turn, surfaces non-`end_turn` stop reasons
    instead of silently printing an empty/truncated reply, and shows minimal tool-call progress
    outside `--debug`; `--version` and `--model`'s default now track the real package
    version/`DEFAULT_CHAT_MODEL` instead of a hardcoded literal.
  - **rest-api**: `/graph` now includes `roleEdges`; added 400/404 response schemas to the OpenAPI
    spec; fixed `/search`'s inconsistent error body for a missing vs. empty `q`; the OpenAPI
    `info.version` now tracks the package's real version.
  - **mcp-server**: added a `get_team_dependencies` tool (previously only reachable via REST);
    `get_org_graph` now includes `roleEdges`; `find_service_owner`'s exact-match semantics are now
    disclosed in its description and error message; the reported server `version` now tracks the
    real package version instead of a hardcoded literal.
  - **chat**: pinned `zod` back to the same range as every sibling package (was on a different major
    than `core`/`schema`/`mcp-server`), while keeping `betaZodTool` working correctly by importing
    the `zod/v4` subpath explicitly — zod 3.25+ bundles both APIs in one package, so this eliminates
    two coexisting zod majors in the workspace without breaking the Anthropic SDK's zod helper.
